# Day1(April 6th):
Created the necessary Repositories to store and fetch data from classes Employee, Department and Expenses

## Working Functions for department for Department:

1. Add, Remove and Search and Update Works

# TODO
1. Complete the UML at last hopefully
2. Make expense functions
3. Try to make the csv format better

# Refactoring
1. Try to change the expense amount only without need
   of adding the entire Expense __init__ values.

2. Make sure the added messsage is printed when we add employees. 
   (The expense has the print)
